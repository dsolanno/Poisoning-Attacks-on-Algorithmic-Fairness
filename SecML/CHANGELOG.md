## v0.12 (11/03/2020)
- #726 Refactored kernel package (now `secml.ml.kernels`). Kernel classes are now inherited from `CModule`, which enables computing gradients more efficiently. This will enable us to use kernels as preprocessors in future releases.
- #755 Package `secml.ml.model_zoo` has been moved to `secml.model_zoo`.
- #721 Dictionary with model zoo definitions is now dynamically downloaded and updated from our repository located at https://gitlab.com/secml/secml-zoo. The package `model_zoo.models` containing python scripts defining models structure is now removed and the scripts will be downloaded from the same repository upon request.

### Added (7 changes)
- #660 `CClassifierPyTorch` now accepts as input a PyTorch learning rate scheduler via the `optimizer_scheduler` parameter.
- #678 Added new parameter `return_optimizer` to `CClassifierPyTorch.get_state` which allows getting the state of the classifier without including the state of the `optimizer` (and of the new `optimizer_scheduler`).
- Added `random_state` parameter to `CPSKMedians`.
- Added the parameter `minlength` to the `bincount` method of `CArray`.
- Added new `CNormalizerTFIDF` which implements a term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency features normalizer.
- #666 Added new `utils.download_utils.dl_file_gitlab` function which allows downloading a file from a [gitlab.com](https://gitlab.com) repository, including branch and access token setting.
- #722 Added new optional parameter `headers` to `utils.download_utils.dl_file` function which allows specifying additional headers for the download request.

### Improved (8 changes)
- #664 The following `CClassifierPyTorch` parameters can now be modified after instancing the class: `optimizer`, `epochs`, `batch_size`. This will make some procedures easier, like fine-tuning a pre-trained network.
- #712 `download_utils.dl_file()` will now use the filename stored in response's headers if available. The previous behavior (get the last part of the download url) will be used as a fallback.
- #748 `CNormalizerUnitNorm` re-factored by adding gradient computation.
- #706 Rewrite `CKernelRBF` gradient when passing `w` to speed up computations by avoiding broadcasting.
- #730 `CClassifierPyTorch` has been modified to clean cached outputs and save memory when caching such data is not required.
- Internally optimized variables can be stored inside the attack class and fetched when needed.
- Accurate evaluation of objective function for some cleverhans attacks (CW, Elastic Net).
- #666 Model zoo downloader `ml.model_zoo.load_model` function will now try to download the version of a requested model corresponding to the version of secml. If not found, the latest 'master' version of the model will be downloaded instead.

### Changed (3 changes)
- #664 When passing pre-trained models to `CClassifierDNN` and subclasses the new `pretrained` parameter should now be set to `True`. Optionally, an array of classes on which the model has been pre-trained can be passed via the new `pretrained_classes` parameter. If `pretrained_classes` is left `None`, the number of classes will be inferred from the size of the last DNN layer as before.
- `CConstraintL2.project(x)` projects now `x` onto a hypersphere of radius `radius-tol`, with `tol=1e-6`. This conservative projection ensures that `x` is projected always inside the hypersphere, overcoming projection violations due to numerical rounding errors.
- `CModule.gradient` is not calling `forward` anymore, but only prepares data for `backward`. The forward step is not required, indeed, for modules that implement analytical gradients rather than autodiff.

### Fixed (10 changes)
- #677 Fixed `CClassifierPyTorch.get_state` crashing when optimizer is not defined.
- #134 Fixed passage of `n_jobs` parameter to `CDataLoaderPyTorch` in `CClassifierPyTorch` where 2 processes are being used by the loader even if `n_jobs` is set to 1. The default value for parameter `num_workers` in `CDataLoaderPyTorch` is now correctly 0.
- #749 Fixed `CArray.argmin` and `.argmax` returning float types when applied to sparse arrays of float dtype.
- Gradient is now correctly computed in `CClassifierPytorch` even if `softmax_outputs` are active.
- #707 Fixed initial value of the objective function being computed before starting point projection in `COptimizerPGDLS`.
- #667 Fixed `download_utils.dl_file()` not removing url parameters from the name of the stored file.
- #715 `download_utils.dl_file()` now correctly manage the absence of the 'content-length' header from response.
- Inverted sign of computed kernel similarity (to have a distance measure).
- #710 Random seed in `CClassifierPyTorch` is now correctly applied also when running on the CuDNN backend.
- #639: Objective function parameter (`objective_function`) in `CAttackEvasionCleverhans` is now correctly populated for `ElasticNetMethod` and `SPSA` attacks.

### Removed & Deprecated (5 changes)
- #748 `CNormalizerUnitNorm.inverse_transform` has been removed (it only worked if one inverted `x` after transforming it, but not if other transforms were applied in between).
- Removed the parameters `n_feats` and `n_classes` from the interface of `CAttackEvasionCleverhans`.
- #744 Deprecate kernel parameter from `CClassifierSGD` and `CClassifierRidge` and removed deprecated parameter `kernel='linear'` from notebook `01-Training.ipynb`.
- #643 Removed deprecated parameter `random_seed` from `CClassifierLogistic`. Use `random_state` instead.
- #643 Removed deprecated method `is_linear` from `CClassifier`, `CNormalizer`, and related subclasses.
